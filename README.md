# Introduction
The OpenVINO™ toolkit quickly deploys applications and solutions that emulate human vision. Based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), the Toolkit extends computer vision (CV) workloads across Intel® hardware, maximizing performance.

This project is a ROS2 wrapper for CV API of OpenVINO™, providing the following features:
* Support CPU and GPU platforms
* Support standard USB camera and Intel® RealSense™ camera
* Support Video or Image file as detection source
* Face detection
* Emotion recognition
* Age and gender recognition
* Head pose recognition
* Demo application to show above detection and recognitions

**Note**:We provide two ways to install the OpenVINO™ toolkit:<br>
From Binary version [OpenVINO™](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit) toolkit installation, please refer to *TAR_BALL_README.md*.<br>
From OpenVINO toolkit open source code installation,please refer to *OPEN_SOURCE_CODE_README.md*
